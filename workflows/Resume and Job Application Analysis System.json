I am considering applying for this job and need your expertise to assess how well my resume aligns with the job description and identify opportunities to improve my resume for this role.\n\nFollow the steps outlined below. Use clear formatting, standardized methods for evaluation, and examples where applicable to ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Review the Job Description**\n\nHere is the job description for your review:\n\n<job_description>\n{{ $json.posting }}\n</job_description>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Review My Resume**\n\nHere is my resume for your review:\n\n<resume>\n{{ $json.resume }}\n</resume>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Job Fit**\n\n#### **Step 3.1: Break Down the Job Description**\n\nOrganize the job description into the following categories:\n\n- **Job Responsibilities**: Key tasks and duties.\n- **Required Skills/Qualifications**: Must-haves (e.g., degrees, certifications, years of experience).\n- **Preferred Skills**: Nice-to-haves but not mandatory.\n- **Soft Skills**: Interpersonal or cultural competencies.\n\n#### **Step 3.2: Match Experience to Requirements**\n\nFor each category, compare your resume with the job description using a **three-tier rating system**:\n\n- **Fully Meets**: Directly demonstrated in the resume.\n- **Partially Meets**: Related experience or transferable skill is present but not fully aligned.\n- **Does Not Meet**: No evidence of experience or skill in this area.\n\nProvide the analysis in a **table format**.\n\n**Example Table for Fit Analysis**:\n\n|**Requirement**|**Your Skills/Experience**|**Rating**|**Notes**|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|5+ years of project management|6 years leading teams|Fully Meets|Matches requirement completely.|\n|Knowledge of Salesforce CRM|HubSpot CRM experience|Partially Meets|Transferable CRM knowledge.|\n|Bachelor's in Marketing|B.A. in Communications|Partially Meets|Overlap in related coursework.|\n\n#### **Step 3.3: Identify Transferable Skills**\n\nHighlight skills or experiences from the resume that may be applied to the job requirements even if they are not exact matches.\n\n**Example Output**:\n\n- _Requirement_: \"Experience leading marketing campaigns\" → Your role as a project manager involved coordinating marketing and internal campaigns, demonstrating transferable leadership skills.\n- _Requirement_: \"Knowledge of SEO\" → You have basic familiarity with keyword research and content optimization.\n\n#### **Step 3.4: Evaluate Technical Skills**\n\nCompare specific tools, software, or technical expertise mentioned in the job description with those listed in the resume.\n\n**Example Table for Technical Skills**:\n\n|**Tool/Software**|**Your Experience**|**Fit?**|\n|---|---|---|\n|Salesforce CRM|HubSpot CRM experience|Partially Meets|\n|Google Analytics|Advanced user, certified|Fully Meets|\n\n#### **Step 3.5: Assess Soft Skills**\n\nEvaluate soft skills listed in the job description and provide examples from the resume that demonstrate these.\n\n**Example Output**:\n\n- _Requirement_: \"Strong communication skills\" → In your last role, you presented monthly strategy updates to executives, showcasing excellent communication skills.\n- _Requirement_: \"Team player\" → Managed a cross-functional team to deliver projects on time, reflecting collaboration and leadership abilities.\n\n#### **Step 3.6: Address Experience Gaps**\n\nIdentify areas where qualifications are missing or underemphasized and suggest actionable ways to address these in the resume or application.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Provide an Assessment**\n\n#### **4.1: Candidate Fit Summary**\n\n- **Overall Fit Percentage**: Calculate the percentage match based on this weightage:\n    - **Required Skills**: 50%\n    - **Preferred Skills**: 30%\n    - **Soft Skills**: 20%\n\n**Example Fit Calculation**:\n\n- Required Skills: 80% match → Weighted score: 40%\n    \n- Preferred Skills: 50% match → Weighted score: 15%\n    \n- Soft Skills: 90% match → Weighted score: 18%  \n    **Total Fit Percentage**: 73%\n    \n- **Strengths**: Highlight areas where the resume aligns strongly with the job requirements. Use specific quotes from the job description and the resume.\n    \n\n**Example Strengths Output**:\n\n- _Job Description_: \"Proven ability to lead teams.\"\n    \n- _Resume_: \"Led a team of 12 in executing a $1M project, achieving a 20% cost reduction.\"\n    \n- **Weaknesses**: Identify areas of misalignment or missing qualifications and suggest ways to address these.\n    \n\n**Example Weaknesses Output**:\n\n- _Job Description_: \"5+ years of experience in data analysis.\"\n- _Resume_: \"2 years of data analysis experience, primarily in a supporting role.\"\n\n#### **4.2: Salary Information**\n\n- Extract salary/pay information from the job description. If unavailable, state: _\"Salary information was not included.\"_\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Recommend Resume Improvements**\n\nIn this section, provide a detailed suggestions of how I can optimize my resume for both recruiters and ATS systems. Consider the following:\n\n#### **5.1: ATS Optimization**\n\n- Formatting: Ensure that the resume follows simple, traditional formatting with clear section headings (e.g., \"Work Experience,\" \"Education,\" \"Skills\"). Avoid complex layouts, graphics, or tables that could confuse ATS systems.\n- Keywords: Verify that my resume includes keywords directly from the job description. For example, if the job posting mentions \"project management,\" ensure that my resume includes this exact term (and related terms like \"program management\" or \"cross-functional leadership\").\n- Job Titles: Check that the job titles on my resume are standardized. If my role had a unique title, consider adding the industry-standard version in parentheses (e.g., \"Project Manager (Project Lead)\").     \n- Headings: Review my section headings to ensure they match the standard ones used by ATS systems (e.g., \"Work Experience\" instead of \"Where I’ve Worked\").\n- Abbreviations and Acronyms: Check my resume for abbreviations or acronyms that could confuse ATS systems. Make sure to spell out terms at least once, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. For example, \"Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\" should be used instead of just \"SEO.\"\n- Action Verbs: Ensure that my resume uses strong action verbs like \"managed,\" \"developed,\" and \"led\" to clearly highlight achievements and contributions.\n\n\n#### **5.2: Enhancing Compellingness**\n\nProvide recommendations on how I can improve my resume to make it more compelling to recruiters.\n\n- Suggest specific ways to improve the resume:\n    - Add measurable accomplishments (e.g., \"Increased sales by 15% over 12 months\").\n    - Include missing technical or soft skills explicitly.\n    - Reframe descriptions to better align with the job requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions**\n\n- Be thorough in your analysis.\n- Be conversational, supportive yet professional in your tone.\n- Ensure that you include a status for Step 1.\n- Ensure that you include a status for Step 2.\n- Use structured tables and bullet points for clarity.\n- Provide actionable feedback that I can implement to improve my resume and application.\n\n---"

Ensure you maintain a text-based, standardized format. Recommend avoiding two-column layouts or intricate graphics.\n- **Keywords:** \n  - Include explicit keywords like \"Middleware Platforms,\" \"Middleware Infrastructure,\" \"IBM Integration,\" \"WebSphere,\" \"Apache,\" explicitly to attract ATS recognition.\n- **Job Titles:** \n  - Your job titles clearly state responsibility. Consider mapping internal titles clearly to job descriptions, ex: \"Senior Developer & Architect Owner (Middleware/Infrastructure Solutions)\" to match ATS targeted phrases.\n- **Headings:**\n  - Current headings (\"Work Experience,\" \"Education,\" and \"Technical Skills\") are ATS friendly.\n- **Acronyms / Abbreviations:** \n  - Done well. Keep standard acronym expansion format (as you have: Robotic Process Automation (RPA)).\n- **Action Verbs:**\n  - Strong use in current resume already present; try aligning closer to the verbs used in the job description (\"oversee\", \"coach\", \"align\", \"transform\").\n\n### 5.2: Enhancing Compellingness\n\n- **Measurable Outcomes:** Include clearer direct outcomes (e.g., \"Achieved 90% automation rate on invoice processing\"). Consider adding budgetary or financial efficiencies (\"Saved $XXK in resource hours\").\n- **Infrastructure-Related Experience:** Rewrite some project descriptions to clearly outline any indirect infrastructure involvement (platform stability, performance optimization, system-level integrations).\n- **Explicit Middleware experience:** Highlight existing integration experience clearly as Middleware-related platforms. Include projects mentioning F5 integrations more prominently.\n- **Vendor/Budget accountability:** Adjust the current RFI & NRFP descriptions. Highlight your role in assessing financial impacts, resource requirements, or vendor cost savings.\n- **Leadership roles clearly stated:** Adjust your roles to emphasize acting as a mentor and a strategic leader driving decisions/infrastructure planning.\n\n---\n\n## 👍 **Final Notes and Recommendations**\n\nYour resume and experience are solid—aligning strongly, particularly for soft skills, leadership, and Cloud/DevOps capabilities. Explicit Middleware platform experience and budget oversight need clearer emphasis—adapt your resume to surface project examples that emphasize infrastructure-level scope, vendor management, and budget-related impacts clearly.\n\nYou are a compelling candidate for this role. With minor adjustments, your resume and application would benefit greatly and boost your likelihood of capturing the recruiter's immediate attention and effectively passing ATS filters.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need any more support. Wishing you great success in your application!",

                "Analysis": "## **Step 1: Review the Job Description**\n❌ **Status:** Job description not provided. Please provide the job description within the `<job_description>` section.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Review Your Resume**\n✅ **Status:** Resume successfully reviewed.\n\n**Quick Review of Resume:**\n- Significant experience in digital solutions and technology leadership.\n- Proven expertise in modern digital transformations, user experience, enterprise-level platform initiatives, and managerial leadership.\n- Comprehensive educational background (Masters, Bachelors, and technical certifications clearly mentioned).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Analyze Job Fit**\n❌ **Cannot proceed:** Since the job description is currently missing, I can't conduct the full-fit analysis, including the breakdown into required, preferred, technical, and soft skills.\n\nPlease add the job description so I can complete Step 3: Analyze Job Fit.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Provide an Assessment**\n❌ **Cannot proceed:** I need the complete job description to provide a thorough assessment, calculate fit percentage, strengths, weaknesses, and salary insights.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Recommend Resume Improvements**\n\nEven though the job description is currently missing, I can provide actionable improvements based on best-practice insights into ATS optimization and making a resume more compelling for recruiter review. When the job description is provided, we can further tailor improvements specifically to the role.\n\n### ✔️ **5.1 ATS Optimization Recommendations:**\n\n**Formatting:**\n- Continue to leverage simple, clean formatting as you currently have. The resume is already quite ATS-friendly with conventional headings like \"Professional experience,\" \"Education,\" etc.\n- Avoid adding any complex tables, graphs, images, or unusual bullet characters.\n\n**Keywords & Key terms:**\n- Once you have the description, align the keywords precisely. For example, if the job description emphasizes \"agile methodology\" or specific software tools (e.g., Salesforce, Adobe Cloud), explicitly mention these in your resume.\n- Incorporate exact match key phrases like \"enterprise digital solutions,\" \"cross-functional team leadership,\" and \"stakeholder management\" (based on your experience, these types of terms often surface strongly in leadership/management jobs).\n\n**Job Titles:**\n- Your job titles are generally clear, but consider industry-standard alternatives in parentheses if needed—e.g., \"Solutions Lead (Solution Architect)\" if \"Solution Architect\" is more widely recognized in some target roles.\n\n**Acronyms and Abbreviations:**\n- You’ve used many tech-centric tools and terms like UX, M365, ECM. Ensure they're explicitly spelled out at first occurrence (e.g., \"Enterprise Content Management (ECM)\") to fully optimize ATS readability.\n\n**Action Verbs:**\n- You've used some strong verbs like \"led,\" \"managed,\" \"introduced,\" \"championed,\" \"facilitated,\" and \"directed.\" Continue to emphasize these powerful action verbs consistently at the start of bullet points.\n\n### ✔️ **5.2 Enhancing Resume Compellingness:**\nYou have great career achievements, but here are actionable ways to strengthen further:\n\n- **Measurable Accomplishments:**\n  - You began to mention some measurable results such as \"increase in uptime\" and continuous deployment from quarterly to weekly. To further enhance:\n    - Add measurable percentage increases, e.g., \"Improved time-to-market by 50%\" or \"Reduced downtime by X%,\" providing an explicit number or percent.\n    - Explicitly mention financial results or impacts—say, \"delivered portfolio of initiatives with $X million budget,\" or \"saved $X through improved resource utilization.\"\n\n- **Technical and Soft Skills:**\n  - Add a specialized Skills/Technical Expertise section near the top outlining relevant skills like:\n    ```\n    Skills:\n    - Digital Transformation | Enterprise Architecture | UX & Service Design | Agile Delivery\n    - Technical Stacks: Azure, AWS, M365, SharePoint, Elastic Search, Contentful, Vercel\n    - Methodologies: Agile, DevOps, Design Thinking, Service Blueprinting\n    ```\n  - Soft Skills: Explicit mentions (e.g., \"Effective cross-functional collaborator,\" \"Strong stakeholder management capabilities,\" \"Excellent communicator and facilitator of technical and user-centered workshops\").\n\n- **Role & Results-Oriented Descriptions:**\n  - Instead of just describing the projects, explicitly use a \"challenge–action–results\" approach:\n    - Challenge: Define briefly the initial state/problem.\n    - Action: What specifically did you lead/do?\n    - Results: Clear measurable or qualitative outcomes.\n  - Example Improved Bullet:\n    - **Before:** \"Led the re-platform of ICBC.com to modern cloud stack...\"\n    - **After:** \"Addressed challenges of slow deployment and downtime outages by leading the ICBC.com migration to a modern cloud stack (Contentful, Vercel), achieving continuous deployment (2+ feature releases weekly) and eliminating planned outages, dramatically enhancing customer experience and business agility.\"\n\n### 📌 **General Resume Improvements Based on Current Review:**\n- Ensure reverse-chronological order clearly indicates timelines (small typo correction noted in your resume: role \"Solutions Lead, portal, Search & UX\" shows timeline \"Nov 2021 – Nov 2015\" likely typo and should be corrected).\n- Integrate a more defined career summary at the top to immediately highlight your value and leadership capability explicitly, such as:\n  ```\n  Experienced, results-focused Digital Solutions Manager skilled in orchestrating multimillion-dollar transformations, enterprise architecture, and agile delivery teams. Skilled communicator recognized for creating user-centered, scalable digital solutions across complex environments and driving organizational change and efficiency through modern technologies and strategic planning.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Next Steps:**\n- **Provide the missing <job_description> content**: Once you provide the specific job description, I will return to Steps 3 and 4 to offer the structured analysis, match fit percentage, strengths, and weaknesses to enhance your resume further specifically for that role.\n- **Implement suggested improvements** in your resume as listed above for quick gains in ATS readability and recruiter appeal during initial screening.\n\nOnce you add the job description, I’ll gladly assist further in optimizing your application!"

                "Analysis": "## **Step 1: Review the Job Description**\n❌ **Status:** Job description not provided. Please provide the job description within the `<job_description>` section.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Review Your Resume**\n✅ **Status:** Resume successfully reviewed.\n\n**Quick Review of Resume:**\n- Significant experience in digital solutions and technology leadership.\n- Proven expertise in modern digital transformations, user experience, enterprise-level platform initiatives, and managerial leadership.\n- Comprehensive educational background (Masters, Bachelors, and technical certifications clearly mentioned).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Analyze Job Fit**\n❌ **Cannot proceed:** Since the job description is currently missing, I can't conduct the full-fit analysis, including the breakdown into required, preferred, technical, and soft skills.\n\nPlease add the job description so I can complete Step 3: Analyze Job Fit.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Provide an Assessment**\n❌ **Cannot proceed:** I need the complete job description to provide a thorough assessment, calculate fit percentage, strengths, weaknesses, and salary insights.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Recommend Resume Improvements**\n\nEven though the job description is currently missing, I can provide actionable improvements based on best-practice insights into ATS optimization and making a resume more compelling for recruiter review. When the job description is provided, we can further tailor improvements specifically to the role.\n\n### ✔️ **5.1 ATS Optimization Recommendations:**\n\n**Formatting:**\n- Continue to leverage simple, clean formatting as you currently have. The resume is already quite ATS-friendly with conventional headings like \"Professional experience,\" \"Education,\" etc.\n- Avoid adding any complex tables, graphs, images, or unusual bullet characters.\n\n**Keywords & Key terms:**\n- Once you have the description, align the keywords precisely. For example, if the job description emphasizes \"agile methodology\" or specific software tools (e.g., Salesforce, Adobe Cloud), explicitly mention these in your resume.\n- Incorporate exact match key phrases like \"enterprise digital solutions,\" \"cross-functional team leadership,\" and \"stakeholder management\" (based on your experience, these types of terms often surface strongly in leadership/management jobs).\n\n**Job Titles:**\n- Your job titles are generally clear, but consider industry-standard alternatives in parentheses if needed—e.g., \"Solutions Lead (Solution Architect)\" if \"Solution Architect\" is more widely recognized in some target roles.\n\n**Acronyms and Abbreviations:**\n- You’ve used many tech-centric tools and terms like UX, M365, ECM. Ensure they're explicitly spelled out at first occurrence (e.g., \"Enterprise Content Management (ECM)\") to fully optimize ATS readability.\n\n**Action Verbs:**\n- You've used some strong verbs like \"led,\" \"managed,\" \"introduced,\" \"championed,\" \"facilitated,\" and \"directed.\" Continue to emphasize these powerful action verbs consistently at the start of bullet points.\n\n### ✔️ **5.2 Enhancing Resume Compellingness:**\nYou have great career achievements, but here are actionable ways to strengthen further:\n\n- **Measurable Accomplishments:**\n  - You began to mention some measurable results such as \"increase in uptime\" and continuous deployment from quarterly to weekly. To further enhance:\n    - Add measurable percentage increases, e.g., \"Improved time-to-market by 50%\" or \"Reduced downtime by X%,\" providing an explicit number or percent.\n    - Explicitly mention financial results or impacts—say, \"delivered portfolio of initiatives with $X million budget,\" or \"saved $X through improved resource utilization.\"\n\n- **Technical and Soft Skills:**\n  - Add a specialized Skills/Technical Expertise section near the top outlining relevant skills like:\n    ```\n    Skills:\n    - Digital Transformation | Enterprise Architecture | UX & Service Design | Agile Delivery\n    - Technical Stacks: Azure, AWS, M365, SharePoint, Elastic Search, Contentful, Vercel\n    - Methodologies: Agile, DevOps, Design Thinking, Service Blueprinting\n    ```\n  - Soft Skills: Explicit mentions (e.g., \"Effective cross-functional collaborator,\" \"Strong stakeholder management capabilities,\" \"Excellent communicator and facilitator of technical and user-centered workshops\").\n\n- **Role & Results-Oriented Descriptions:**\n  - Instead of just describing the projects, explicitly use a \"challenge–action–results\" approach:\n    - Challenge: Define briefly the initial state/problem.\n    - Action: What specifically did you lead/do?\n    - Results: Clear measurable or qualitative outcomes.\n  - Example Improved Bullet:\n    - **Before:** \"Led the re-platform of ICBC.com to modern cloud stack...\"\n    - **After:** \"Addressed challenges of slow deployment and downtime outages by leading the ICBC.com migration to a modern cloud stack (Contentful, Vercel), achieving continuous deployment (2+ feature releases weekly) and eliminating planned outages, dramatically enhancing customer experience and business agility.\"\n\n### 📌 **General Resume Improvements Based on Current Review:**\n- Ensure reverse-chronological order clearly indicates timelines (small typo correction noted in your resume: role \"Solutions Lead, portal, Search & UX\" shows timeline \"Nov 2021 – Nov 2015\" likely typo and should be corrected).\n- Integrate a more defined career summary at the top to immediately highlight your value and leadership capability explicitly, such as:\n  ```\n  Experienced, results-focused Digital Solutions Manager skilled in orchestrating multimillion-dollar transformations, enterprise architecture, and agile delivery teams. Skilled communicator recognized for creating user-centered, scalable digital solutions across complex environments and driving organizational change and efficiency through modern technologies and strategic planning.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Next Steps:**\n- **Provide the missing <job_description> content**: Once you provide the specific job description, I will return to Steps 3 and 4 to offer the structured analysis, match fit percentage, strengths, and weaknesses to enhance your resume further specifically for that role.\n- **Implement suggested improvements** in your resume as listed above for quick gains in ATS readability and recruiter appeal during initial screening.\n\nOnce you add the job description, I’ll gladly assist further in optimizing your application!"
